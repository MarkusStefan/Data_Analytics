# Associate Rule Learning
This exercise deals with the (elementary) unsupervised learning techniques used for data mining.
The concepts are very simplistic but powerful. 

In the lecture and exercise, we only touched upon the apriori algorithm without investigating how it exactly works.
I implemented my own version of the **apriori algorithm** in python - take a look and try to understand whats going on ;-)
